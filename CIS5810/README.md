## Abstract
This study presents an Augmented Reality (AR) Sudoku Solver that integrates image processing and machine learning for the detection and solution of Sudoku puzzles in both static images and video feeds. The system employs classic image processing techniques and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for grid and digit extraction. For puzzle solving, an efficient implementation of Donald Knuthâ€™s Algorithm X, using Dancing Links, is utilized. An innovation is the integration of a distance-based grid tracking algorithm for dynamic video analysis, enhancing real-time processing capabilities. The system supports detection of multiple grids in the same image, detection of handwritten and printed digits, and demonstrates robustness in varied lightings, orientations, and Sudoku media (printouts, newspapers, computer screens). All of this is done without significant resources using a smartphone camera wirelessly connected to a MacBook Air running on CPU.
