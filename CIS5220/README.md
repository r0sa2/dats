## Abstract
In this project we compare the performance of deep learning models, 
specifically transformers and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, against 
traditional machine learning baselines in a healthcare context. Our 
investigation explores the impact of data augmentation and importance weight 
adjustments on model performance, particularly in addressing class imbalance 
and improving prediction accuracy. Results demonstrate the superior performance 
of deep learning models over machine learning baselines across various 
performance metrics. Notably, transformers exhibit promising results with fewer 
training epochs compared to LSTMs. Furthermore, the study reveals distinct 
sensitivities of transformers and LSTMs to changes in importance weights, 
highlighting the need for further research into model architectures and 
optimization techniques. The findings contribute to a broader understanding of 
artificial intelligence applications in healthcare, emphasizing the potential 
and challenges of AI-driven decision-making in medical settings.
