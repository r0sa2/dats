# Live Poets Society
This project is for the course *CIS 5500: Database and Information Systems (Spring 2023)*. 
The project repository can be found 
[here](https://github.com/NimayRKumar/cis550_project).

## Abstract
In this project we have created a social cataloging application specifically 
for poetry lovers. Our aim was to make a platform that enables users to explore
the world of poetry through an extensive collection of books, series, authors, 
and reviews.

The application is designed to offer a personalized experience to each user. By 
signing in, users can create and maintain their own virtual library of poetry 
books, rate them, and receive custom recommendations based on their past 
behaviour about new poetry books that they might enjoy.

In addition to these features, the application also seeks to encourage 
community engagement. This is achieved by providing information about author
perceptions in the community, and highlighting the most active members of the 
community, which allows users to learn more about other members.

Overall, we hope the application can serve as a valuable resource for poetry 
enthusiasts of all levels, whether they are just starting out or are seasoned
experts.
