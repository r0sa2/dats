## Abstact
In this project, we present our work on developing multimodal approaches for disaster tweet classification. We explore the use of text and
image data to automatically classify tweets as informative or not informative for humanitarian aid purposes. Our research addresses the challenges of processing and analyzing social media data during disasters and leverages machine learning techniques to improve disaster response. Our best performing model is an attention-based multimodal model that also integrates information about the specific disaster event name. It achieves a test accuracy of 0.787 and F-score of 0.773, noticeably beating our majority-class and unimodal baselines.
