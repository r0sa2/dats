# Review of "Scale-Up: An Efficient Black-Box Input-Level Backdoor Detection Via Analyzing Scaled Prediction Consistency"
This project is for the course *CIS 7000-004: Trustworthy Machine Learning (Spring 2024)*.

## Abstract
In this study, I review and evaluate SCALE-UP, a black-box input-level backdoor detection method designed for Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) settings. I begin by summarizing some key aspects of the paper’s motivation, setting, methodology, and experimental results. I then extend the paper’s analysis by conducting my own set of evaluation experiments to test SCALE-UP’s performance for different backdoor attacks (BadNets, Blended) and datasets (MNIST, GTSRB, Imagenette). Finally, I discuss some strengths and weaknesses of the paper based on my reading of it and the results of my evaluation experiments.
